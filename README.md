# Discord-Advice-Bot
This bot is written in javascript. It replies with a random advice when its command is used.

# Setup
1. After forking the code, run `npm install` on your console.
2. Once the installation is completed, place your discord bot token and the prefix that your bot should use in appropriate place inside `config.json.example` file.
3. Rename `config.json.example` file to `config.json`.
4. Run `node index.js` on your console.

Your bot should be working now :)
